### Homework
> Email verification: There is no email verification right now in our application. Anyone can register with a random email. Write the logic to send an email verification mail to newly registered users with a verification link and verify userâ€™s email once he clicks on the link.

> Edit Profile: Add an edit profile page where a user can change his name, username, email, and password.

> Forgot Password: Add forgot password functionality in the app.
